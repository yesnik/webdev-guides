# IT Terms

- **CGI** - Common Gateway Interface; a mechanism used by most web servers to process data received from a client browser (e.g., a user). 
CGI scripts contain the instructions that tell the web server what to do with the data. 
- **DHCP** - Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol; 
a protocol that lets a server on a local network assign temporary IP addresses to a computer or other network devices. 
- **DNS** - Domain Name System; a service for accessing a networked computer by name rather than by numerical, (IP) address.
- **Ethernet** - A popular network technology that enables data to travel at 10 megabits per second. 
Campus microcomputers connected to a network have Ethernet cards installed that are attached to Ethernet cabling. 
An Ethernet connection is often referred to as a "direct connection" and is capable of providing data transmission speeds over 500 Kbps. 
- **FTP** - File Transfer Protocol; a method of exchanging files between computers via the Internet. 
Files can contain documents or programs and can be ASCII text or binary data. 
- **GPS** - Global Positioning System; a collection of Earth-orbiting satellites. In a more common context, 
GPS actually refers to a GPS receiver which uses a mathematical principle called "trilateration" 
that can tell you exactly where you are on Earth at any moment. 
- **GUI** - Graphical user interface; a mouse-based system that contains icons, drop-down menus, 
and windows where you point and click to indicate what you want to do. 
- **IMAP** - Internet Message Access Protcol. A method of accessing e-mail messages on a server without downloading them to your local hard drive; it is the main difference between IMAP and POP3 which requires messages to be downloaded to a user's hard drive before the message can be read. 
- **Internet** is a technical infrastructure which allows billions of computers to be connected all together. 
The Internet is an infrastructure, whereas the Web is a service built on top of the infrastructure. 
There are several other services built on top of the Internet, such as email and IRC.
- **IP address** - Internet Protocol address; every computer connected to the Internet has a unique identifying number. 
Example: `192.168.10.2`
